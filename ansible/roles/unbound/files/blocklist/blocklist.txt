# This is a list of blocklist URL that we will use to generate unbound configuration.
# The generate.sh script will extract the domain to block based on the following rules:
#
#   hostfile      a blocklist that is in hostfile format e.g. "127.0.0.1 example.com"
#   domainonly    a blocklist that contains only domain names to block e.g. "example.com"
#
# A line begin with # will be ignored.
